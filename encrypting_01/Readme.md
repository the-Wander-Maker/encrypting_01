In this small example I would like to show how to implement a basic encryption task in object-oriented C++.

The task seems simple, but could be very complicated for beginners.

The task is, to write a program which can encrypt any given text and encrypt and decode it on a console app.

You should use a standard or simple encryption, all matters is that the process should completely have to be able forward and backward compatible.

I used a simple letter char shifting technique.
